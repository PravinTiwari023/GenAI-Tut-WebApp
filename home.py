    st.write("""
    Generative AI refers to algorithms that can create new data, such as images, text, or code, from a given dataset. Popular examples include OpenAI's GPT series, DALLÂ·E, and diffusion models.

    With generative models, you can produce realistic content, automate processes, and improve efficiency in various fields, from creative arts to technical industries.
